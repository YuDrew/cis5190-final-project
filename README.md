# Improving Amazon Recommendations with Sparse Data

**Authors**: Hassan Hammoud, Andrew Yu, Venugopal Chillal

## Main Code
- `notebook.ipynb` - has baseline results
- `ALS.ipynb` - has ALS code and results
- `SAR.ipynb` - has SAR code and results
- `lightgcn/lightgcn.ipynb` - has LightGCN code, results are listed in different results CSVs

## Replicating Our Code
LightGCN yaml files and builds are in their own folder, as well as the annotated notebook. For SAR and ALS, feel free to just look at the relevant notebooks for the output. To replicate this on your machine, feel free to copy the notebooks, making sure to change the file path for the data to wherever you have it stored.
